There are a few ways to create a bootable USB. The first way I will explain uses a program called Rufus. Rufus is a program that makes creating bootable USB's very simple and straightforward.
Note that you will need a USB with at least 8GB of storage Space.

Step 1. Download the Rufus program which can be found here https://rufus.ie/en/
Step 2. Locate the ISO file on your PC for the Operating System you wish to install.
Step 3. Plug in your USB and run the program.
Step 4. Set the paramaters in the program for what you want and click "Start" in the program window and wait for it to finish. it's that easy.

Another way to create a bootable USB uses a similar program to Rufus called "Windows Media Creation Tool". 

Step 1. Install the Application here https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows11
Step 2. Plug-in your USB and Open the Media Creation tool and follow the prompts.
Step 3. Apply your desired settings and click "Start"
